# MoodBot üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Ziyad Ahammed's Team

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Ziyad Ahammed - Government Engineering College, Kozhikode

### Project Description
MoodBot is not just any ordinary AI; it's your hilarious sidekick designed to turn frowns into laughter! Developed out of sheer curiosity for the Useless Projects Make-a-thon by TinkerHub, MoodBot combines ai technology with a playful spirit. It analyzes your facial expressions and listens to your voice, responding with jokes and lighthearted banter that match your mood. With MoodBot, you get a unique experience where humor meets artificial intelligence, creating a delightful interaction that proves technology can be fun!


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world where robots are expected to be serious and efficient, why can't we have a whimsical companion that not only understands our moods but also entertains us with jokes? The absence of a playful AI sidekick to lighten our daily grind left us pondering: could we create a bot that feels more like a friend than a machine?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing MoodBot: the hilariously curious AI companion! This project started as a fun experiment to see if an AI could accurately gauge our emotions through facial expressions and voice input. Why not combine humor with technology? MoodBot detects your mood and responds with witty comments and jokes tailored to your feelings, proving that even AI can bring a smile to your face. It‚Äôs a whimsical take on interaction that no one knew they needed, but now can't live without!
